# Forest Cover Type Prediction
Group Project: Rayna Liu, Yuan Meng, and Zheyue Wang

## Objective and Goal
To predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables. This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.

## Dataset
This dataset comes from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction). It contains 15,120 observations in **train.csv.zip**, 56,5892 observations in **test.csv.zip**.
